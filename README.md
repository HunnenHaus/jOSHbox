Introduction:

   This repository is going to contain all the information gathered pertaining to the feasibility of creating an open source      Vehicle Communication Interface (VCI).

It is being created due to an increasing need in the automotive repair industry to provide a means for vehicle firmware replacement and also to utilize manufacturer specific diagnostic strategy and software applications.
